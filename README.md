## 🎯 Where I'm At Right Now

Let's be real - I'm a complete beginner. Like, Google-every-other-term beginner. But that's the exciting part.

I'm a first-year cybersecurity student trying to figure out if I want to:
- Break into systems (ethically, FBI please don't watch me)
- Build AI stuff (because robots are cool)
- Both? (probably both)

Right now my GitHub is pretty empty, but hey, everyone starts somewhere.

## 📚 What I'm Actually Learning

No BS, here's what I'm genuinely working on:

- **Python basics** - loops, functions, not getting syntax errors every 5 seconds
- **Linux commands** - still Googling "how to exit vim" sometimes
- **Networking fundamentals** - learning what TCP/IP actually means
- **Basic security concepts** - CIA triad (not the agency), encryption, that stuff
- **Git & GitHub** - you're literally looking at my practice right now

## 🛠️ My Current "Arsenal" (aka What I've Touched)

```
Currently Installed:
├── Python (barely writing scripts)
├── java  (knows nothing)
├── VS Code (my old buddy)
├── Cursor(my new buddy)
├── Kali Linux VM (looks cool, still learning what half the tools do)
├── ChatGPT (my debugging partner)
└── YouTube tutorials (my actual teacher)

Skill Level: Tutorial Hell Resident
```

## 💭 Questions I'm Currently Asking

- What's the difference between a library and a framework?
- How do hackers actually... hack?
- Should I learn C or Python first? (picked Python, seems easier)
- What even IS machine learning?
- Why do I have 47 tabs open about the same error?

## 🎮 My Learning Style

I learn by:
1. Watching a tutorial
2. Thinking "that looks easy"
3. Trying it myself
4. Breaking everything
5. Googling the error
6. Finally getting it to work
7. Feeling like a genius
8. Forgetting how I did it next week

## 📊 GitHub Stats (Empty But Growing)

  *These stats will look better once I actually push some code lol*

## 🎯 My 2026 Goals

**Realistic stuff:**
- Build 3-5 actual Python projects (even if they're simple)
- Complete a beginner CTF (Capture The Flag) challenge
- Understand basic web vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection, etc.)
- Make my first open-source contribution
- Maybe build a simple AI project (keyword: simple)

**Dream stuff:**
- Not Google every syntax error
- Actually understand what "adversarial machine learning" means
- Build something cool that combines security + AI

## 🌱 Current Projects

Right now: **Nothing public yet**

But I'm working on:
- Following Python tutorials and actually coding along
- Setting up my environment properly
- Learning Git commands beyond commit and push
- Planning my first actual project (probably something basic)

I'll update this when I have something worth sharing!

## 🤝 Let's Connect

If you're also a beginner, let's struggle together. If you're experienced, I'd love to learn from you!

> "Everyone who's good at something was once terrible at it."

- It's okay to not know things
- Google is not cheating, it's a tool
- Errors are just the computer's way of teaching you
- The cybersecurity community is actually pretty welcoming
- AI is less scary than it sounds
- Stack Overflow has saved my life multiple times

## 🎪 Fun Facts

- My code works: ❌
- My code works and I know why: ❌
- My code works and I don't know why: ✅
- Coffee to code ratio: 3:1
- Imposter syndrome level: Maximum
